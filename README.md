Abstract 

One of the most integral part of human civilization has been agriculture. Since the times when humans settled down from nomads to the rapid development in todayâ€™s world, Agriculture and agriculture related activities have always played an anchor role. Not just the Global Economy but also India, being an agro-based country, is heavily dependant on Agricultural activities to contribute and strengthen the GDP. And as the Modern day technology has advanced to greater scales, the introduction of Technology in Agriculture brings forth an essential advantage: detection of plant disease in the early stages. But manual detection of plant diseases proves to be time-consuming process and prone to errors, thus it can be an unreliable method to identify and prevent the spread of plant diseases and may ultimately lead to crop failure. Advanced technologies such ML and DL have been adopted to help overcome these issues by providing early identification of plant diseases. Abundant researches have proved the robustness of ML and DL techniques which include k-means clustering, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour,  Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and so on. They have proven effective for specialized model for  








identification in monoculture farming for specialized plants. The research introduces a generalized method for Plant Disease Detection across various conditions. It also establishes a thorough comparative study involving some of the most popular models designed to develop interfaces for Plant Disease Predictions. Finally the aim of this paper is to keep the upcoming researchers updated with the performances, evaluations, and the results of the already established techniques and methods to predict different types of plants diseases leveraging image processing techniques and methods.
